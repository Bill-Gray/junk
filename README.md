# junk
Odd snips and snaps of code : tests of VT100/xterm control sequences,  an
alternative method of computing pendulum swing time,  code to convert the
Unifont HEX formatted fonts to PSF2 (for use in PDCurses),  a try at an
near-optimal stategy for Battleship (R),  astronomical exposure calculator,
X11 clipboard reading/setting,  etc.  This is where I put code that doesn't
fit in other categories.
